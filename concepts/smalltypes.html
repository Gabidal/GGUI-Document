<h1>
    Event - Basis of I/O
</h1>
<p>
    The Event structure only hold one value which is an u64bit size bit mask of criteria of which an EventHandler needs to have for it to be activated.
</p>

<h1>
    Input - Giver of trigger
</h1>
<p>
    When an keyboard event occurs or a mouse event occurs, this Input object is created with the description of what is being triggered in the Criteria field given by the Event base class.
</p>

<h1>
    Action - Taker of trigger
</h1>
<p>
    When inputs occur, all registered EventHandlers, e.g Action objects are combed through to find the Action whose Criteria flags equals to the corresponding Input criteria.
    If an match is found then the function pointer "Job" is run, the Job can return an boolean whether it wants to halt the propagation of said event or not.
</p>

<h1>
    Memory - Timed trigger
</h1>
<p>
    Memory is a Action inheritant, whose job is to trigger after a specific time, after the trigger has been matched.
    Memories on activation will run their assigned "Job". Memories can also be given an "re-trigger" flag, which will prolong the current memory if another is triggered, instead of spawning another memory.
</p>

<h1>
    STAIN - optimized flush agent
</h1>
<p>
    The STAIN enum contains bit masks each corresponding to each part of an element render pipeline, so that redundant re-calculation would not occur.
    This gives GGUI the ability to automatically notice if even anything needs to be re-drawn or if it can just use the previous render buffer.
</p>

<h1>
    Guard - Atomic helper
</h1>
<p>
    The Guard class is a simple wrapper for the mutexes and their condition variable setup and safe call, with automatic wrapping when called with the caller operator overload.
</p>

<h1>
    FVector2
</h1>
<p>
    Simple two floating point, vector structure.
</p>

<h1>
    FVector3
</h1>
<p>
    Inherits FVector2 and adds the third dimension.
</p>

<h1>
    IVector2
</h1>
<p>
    Simple integer vector made up two s16bit containers. 
</p>

<h1>
    IVector3
</h1>
<p>
    Inherits IVector2 and adds the third dimension.
</p>
