<h1>
    Color - Basis of TUI rendering
</h1>

<p>
    Base class of all colors is the RGB structure with three u8bit color channels, this is used to render the final color into the terminal buffer.
    Additionally RGBA is a inheritant of RGB class, adding the opacity channel totaling in 32bits, the alpha channel is used in the nesting phase of child elements, determining how much effect they leave into the parent buffer.
    RGBA follows the subtractive color scheme, where the more you add colors up the closer the result will be to the color black.

    For quick access GGUI offers pre-made colors under the COLOR::* namespace.

    Let's keep this simple class in mind and move to the other two classes which with this class make up the rendering units. UTF class.
