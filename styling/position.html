<h1>
    Position - Absolute And Relative
</h1>
<p>
    In GGUI position style can take float values ranging from [0.0f, 1.0f] and integer numbers between [-s16int, +s16int].
    When using decimal values, GGUI will use them as relative value to its parent width if x and height if y.
    Z does not support relative value, since current Zs value is always parent->Z+1.

<p style="color: red">
    Note: When calculating the current element dimensions is also considered, so that when position is at 100%, we subtract the dimension value from the position when its transformed into absolute values.
</p>

    <code>
// Giving integer values to position position will use them as relative positions inside the parents area.
position(IVector3(...))
position(IVector2(...))

// Notice, that using floating point values position will use it as a center-origin type values.
position(FVector3(...))
position(FVector2(...))

// You can mix floating point values and integer values, where the floating point values use the center origin value and the integer value uses top-left origin.
position(0.0f, 0)   // this is top middle

// The floating point values use center origin values, so that you can do something like this.
position(STYLES::top + STYLES::left)
