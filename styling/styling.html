<h1>
    Styling - CSS Styling In HTML Form
</h1>
<p>
    Style GGUI was introduced in 0.1.8 update with the dynamic styling system, where on user can add different types of styles while also structuring their whole application similar how it would be displayed.
    in STYLING_INTERNAL::* namespace resides the style_base class, which contains the necessaries for the addition for OOP styled style objects which are passed at construction time passed either with && or & reference.
</p>

<pre title="Basic use of style class">
    <code>
// Here we have two style_base inheritants which are added together, returning a new style_base* which can be added further or given to an renderable element object.
textColor(COLOR::RED) | backgroundColor(COLOR::BLUE)
    </code>
</code>

<p style="color: red;">
    Note: As of 0.1.8 you should not make global styles, instead make local, since each style_base will point to the next style_base*, and on processing one the next pointer is cleared out.
</p>

<p>
    The styling structure allows you to also add elements into the styling itself via the node class, enabling tree like structure at construction phase just like in HTML or XML.
</p>
<pre title="Basic HTML tree in GGUI style node tree">
    <code>
element* someUpperElement = new element(
    node(new element(   // This element will now be a child element under the parenting element declared above
        node(new element(
            // ....
        )) | 
        node(new element(
            // ....
        ))
    )) | 

    // You can also use the child class to skip spamming nodes everywhere, although its not that much cleaner.
    childs({
        new element(
            // ....
        ),
        new element(
            // ....
        )
    })
)
    </code>
</code>

<p style="color: red;">
    Note: With the use of '|' operator appending styles comes a caveat. 
    The order of the operation since of how same level operators are calculated left to right, the un-wrapping of the linked list is thus reversed, so your last added element is first and vise versa.
