<h1>
    Borders - Automated Overhead Reduction
</h1>
<p>
    In the following situations GGUI will optimize the space used by elements with borders and their inner nodes.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If two or more elements with borders enable, collide.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the parent and the child both have borders enable.
    </li>
</ul>
<code>
    enable_border(true)
</code>
<p>
    When borders are enabled and GGUI cannot optimize, this leaves the area inside the parent two cells shorter and thinner.
